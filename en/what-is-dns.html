Humans access information online through domain names, like google.com or nytimes.com. Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources.<p><a href=https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/ >About DNS...</a><h1>What is a DNS record?</h1><p>DNS records (aka zone files) are instructions that live in authoritative DNS servers and provide information about a domain including what IP address is associated with that domain and how to handle queries for that domain.<p><a href=https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/ >About DNS records...</a><h1>What is a DNS root server?</h1><p>A root server is the first step in translating (resolving) human-readable hostnames into IP addresses. It can be thought of like a librarian in a library that points to different bookshelves – typically it serves as a reference to other, more specific locations.<p><a href=https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/glossary/dns-root-server/ >About DNS root servers...</a><h1>What is a TLD?</h1><p>A top-level domain (TLD) is one of the domains at the highest level in the hierarchical Domain Name System of the Internet after the root domain. For example, in the domain name www.google.com, the top-level domain is com.<p><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain>About TLDs...</a><h1>What is a second-level domain?</h1><p>A second-level domain (SLD) is a domain that is directly below a top-level domain (TLD). For example, in example.com, example is the second-level domain of the .com TLD.<p><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-level_domain>About SLDs...</a><h1>What is a subdomain?</h1><p>A subdomain is an additional part of your main domain name. Subdomains are created to organize and navigate to different sections of your website. You can create multiple subdomains or child domains on your main domain. For example, store.google.com.<p><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdomain>About subdomains...</a><h1>What is an authoritative DNS server?</h1><p>An authoritative DNS server is a server that actually holds, and is responsible for, DNS resource records. This is the server at the bottom of the DNS lookup chain that will respond with the queried resource record, ultimately allowing the web browser making the request to reach the IP address needed to access a website or other web resources.<p><a href=https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-server-types/#authoritative-dns-server>About authoritative DNS servers...</a><h1>What is propagation?</h1><p>DNS propagation is the time it takes for DNS changes to be updated across the entire web. A change to a DNS record can take up to 48 hours to propagate throughout the internet, although it's often much quicker.<p><a href=https://www.techopedia.com/definition/24131/dns-propagation>About DNS propagation...</a><h1>What is TTL?</h1><p>Time to live (TTL) refers to the amount of time or "hops" that a packet is set to exist inside a network before being discarded by a router. TTL is also used in other contexts including HTTP caching and DNS caching.<p><a href=https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/time-to-live-ttl/ >About TTL...</a><h1>What is a registrar?</h1><p>A domain name registrar is a company that manages the reservation of Internet domain names. A domain name registrar must be accredited by a generic top-level domain (gTLD) registry or a country code top-level domain (ccTLD) registry.<p><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name_registrar>About registrars...</a><h1>What is a registry?</h1><p>A domain name registry is a database of all domain names and the associated registrant information in the top-level domains of the Domain Name System (DNS) of the Internet that allow third party entities to request administrative control of a domain name.<p><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name_registry>About registries...</a><h1>What is a WHOIS record?</h1><p>A WHOIS record contains all of the contact information associated with the person, group, or company that registers a particular domain name. Typically, each WHOIS record will contain information such as the name and contact information of the Registrant (who owns the domain), the name and contact information of the Registrar (the organization or commercial entity that registered the domain name), the registration dates, the name servers, the most recent update, and the expiration date.<p><a href=https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/glossary/whois-history/ >About WHOIS records...</a><h1>What is ICANN?</h1><p>The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is a non-profit organization responsible for coordinating the maintenance and procedures of several databases related to the namespaces and numerical spaces of the Internet, ensuring the network's stable and secure operation.<p><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICANN>About ICANN...</a><h1>What is a zone file?</h1><p>A DNS zone file is a text file that describes a DNS zone. A DNS zone is a subset, often a single domain, of the hierarchical Domain Name System (DNS). The zone file contains mappings between domain names and IP addresses and other resources, organized in the form of resource records (RR).<p><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_file>About zone files...</a><h1>What is a FQDN?</h1><p>A fully qualified domain name (FQDN), sometimes also referred to as an absolute domain name, is a domain name that specifies its exact location in the tree hierarchy of the Domain Name System (DNS). It specifies all domain levels, including the top-level domain and the root zone.<p><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name>About FQDNs...</a><h1>What is a glue record?</h1><p>A glue record is a DNS record created at the registry's DNS server that provides the IP address of a specific nameserver. Glue records are required when the nameserver for a domain is a subdomain of the domain itself.<p><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glue_record>About glue records...</a><h1>What is a CNAME record?</h1><p>A Canonical Name record (abbreviated as CNAME record) is a type of resource record in the Domain Name System (DNS) which maps one domain name (an alias) to another (the canonical name).<p><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNAME_record>About CNAME records...</a><h1>What is an MX record?</h1><p>A mail exchanger record (MX record) specifies the mail server responsible for accepting email messages on behalf of a domain name.<p><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MX_record>About MX records...</a><h1>What is an A record?</h1><p>An A record (Address Record) is a DNS record that maps a domain name to an IPv4 address.<p><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_DNS_record_types>About A records...</a><h1>What is a TXT record?</h1><p>A TXT record (short for text record) is a type of DNS record that contains text information for sources outside of your domain. You add these records to your domain settings. You can use TXT records for various purposes. Google uses them to verify domain ownership and to ensure email security.<p><a href=https://support.google.com/a/answer/2716802>About TXT records...</a><h1>What is a PTR record?</h1><p>A pointer record (PTR) is a type of DNS record that resolves an IP address to a domain or hostname. This is the opposite of an A record, which resolves a domain name to an IP address. PTR records are used in reverse DNS lookups.<p><a href=https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-ptr-record/ >About PTR records...</a><h1>What is an ALIAS record?</h1><p>An ALIAS record is a virtual record type we created to provide CNAME-like behavior on the apex domain. For example, if you're using a CNAME record to point example.com to host.anotherdomain.com, you can't have any other records for example.com (like MX records). By using an ALIAS record, you can point the apex domain to another hostname and still have other records for that domain.<p><a href=https://ns1.com/blog/cname-vs-alias-records>About ALIAS records...</a><h1>What is a nameserver?</h1><p>A nameserver is a type of DNS server. It is the server that stores all DNS records for a domain, including A records, MX records, or CNAME records.<p><a href=https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/what-is-a-nameserver/ >About nameservers...</a></div>
