IP addresses serve two main functions: network interface identification, and location addressing.<p><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address>About IP addresses...</a><h1>What different protocols exist for IP addresses?</h1><p>IPv4 - Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4), is the original addressing system. It uses 32-bit addresses, which limits the total number of unique addresses to about 4.3 billion.<p>IPv6 - Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) was developed to deal with the problem of IPv4 address exhaustion. It uses 128-bit addresses, allowing for a virtually unlimited number of unique addresses.<p><a href=https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/ipv4-vs-ipv6/ >About IPv4 vs IPv6...</a><h1>What are dynamic and static IP addresses?</h1><p>A dynamic IP address is a temporary address for devices connected to a network that continually changes over time, while a static IP address is simply an address that doesn't change. Once your device is assigned a static IP address, that number typically stays the same until the device is decommissioned or your network architecture changes. Most internet users use a dynamic IP address.<p><a href=https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/static-vs-dynamic-ip>About dynamic and static IP addresses...</a><h1>Common misconceptions about IP addresses</h1><p>1. "An IP address uniquely identifies a person." - In reality, IP addresses change frequently and can be shared by multiple people or devices.<p>2. "An IP address always shows exactly where you live." - Many IP addresses only reveal an approximate location and not an exact address.<p>3. "Private IP addresses are available on the Internet." - Private IP addresses (e.g. 192.168.1.1) are only used within private networks.<p>4. "A VPN makes you completely anonymous." - A VPN only changes your public IP address, and websites can still use other tracking methods.<p>5. "Knowing someone's IP address means you can hack them." - An IP address alone does not reveal vulnerabilities unless it is associated with security flaws.<p><a href=https://blog.ip2location.com/knowledge-base/ip-geolocation-capabilities-myths-and-facts/ >About common misconceptions about IP addresses...</a></div>
