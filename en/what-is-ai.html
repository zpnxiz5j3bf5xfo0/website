Common AI chatbots include <a href=https://chatgpt.com>ChatGPT</a>, <a href=https://gemini.google.com>Gemini</a>, and <a href=https://copilot.microsoft.com>Copilot</a>.<p><a href=https://www.coursera.org/articles/what-is-artificial-intelligence>About AI...</a><h1>Common misconceptions about AI</h1><p>1. "AI and robots are the same." - AI is the "brain" (software), whereas a robot is the "body" (hardware). While some robots use AI to perform complex tasks, many operate on simple, pre-programmed instructions.<p>2. "AI will replace human intelligence." - AI can outperform humans in repetitive and structured tasks, but when it comes to decision-making or learning on its own, AI is not fully autonomous. AI works through vast amounts of data to extract key information, regardless of its structure and complexity, and makes that data available to human decision-makers.<p>3. "AI is unbiased." - No system can be completely objective, just as no person can be unaffected by the world around them. AI technology is based on the data, rules and inputs created by human experts, meaning it’s vulnerable to human interpretation and biases.<p>4. "AI will take over jobs." - Whenever disruptive technology emerges in the workplace, such as large-scale machinery and transportation in the Industrial Revolution, there are bound to be changes to the types of labor and skills required by human beings. Long term, these technologies bring new fields of research and knowledge, more productivity, higher standards of living, and new jobs and industries.<p>5. "AI and machine learning are the same." - People often confuse AI, ML and deep learning. Machine learning and deep learning are subsets of AI, where computers learn and recognize patterns from large datasets. ML can range in its capabilities, whereas deep learning is a neural network technology with an algorithm designed to mimic the human brain.<p><a href=https://www.blueprism.com/resources/blog/ai-myths-misconceptions/ >About common misconceptions about AI...</a></div>
